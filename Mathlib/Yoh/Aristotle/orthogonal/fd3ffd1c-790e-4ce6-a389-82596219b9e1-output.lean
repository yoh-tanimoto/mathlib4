The following was negated by Aristotle:

- example : ∃ (_ : NormedAddCommGroup H) (_ : InnerProductSpace ℂ H) (K : Submodule ℂ H),
    (IsClosed (K : Set H)) ∧ Kᗮᗮ ≠ K

Here is the code for the `negate_state` tactic, used within these negations:

```lean
import Mathlib
open Lean Meta Elab Tactic in
elab "revert_all" : tactic => do
  let goals ← getGoals
  let mut newGoals : List MVarId := []
  for mvarId in goals do
    newGoals := newGoals.append [(← mvarId.revertAll)]
  setGoals newGoals

open Lean.Elab.Tactic in
macro "negate_state" : tactic => `(tactic|
  (
    guard_goal_nums 1
    revert_all
    refine @(((by admit) : ∀ {p : Prop}, ¬p → p) ?_)
    try (push_neg; guard_goal_nums 1)
  )
)
```

import Mathlib


variable (H : Type)

/- Aristotle found this block to be false. Here is a proof of the negation:



example : ∃ (_ : NormedAddCommGroup H) (_ : InnerProductSpace ℂ H) (K : Submodule ℂ H),
    (IsClosed (K : Set H)) ∧ Kᗮᗮ ≠ K := by
      -- Wait, there's a mistake. We can actually prove the opposite.
      negate_state;
      -- Proof starts here:
      -- Let's choose the trivial Hilbert space $H = \{0\}$.
      use PUnit;
      -- Let's choose any $x \in \mathbb{C}$.
